# Ugly Web

Welcome to Ugly Web, the epitome of poor web design. This project is a showcase of intentional design flaws meant to illustrate what not to do when creating a website.

## Features

- **Bright and Clashing Colors:** Uses highly saturated colors that conflict with each other.
- **Inconsistent Typography:** Combines multiple unrelated fonts without coherence.
- **Excessive Use of Borders and Shadows:** Applies too many borders and shadows, making elements look cluttered.
- **Unnecessary Animations:** Includes distracting animations that serve no functional purpose.
- **Disorganized Layout:** Features a layout that confuses users and hampers navigation.
